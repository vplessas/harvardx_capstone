abstract = {The paper provides a systematic development of the forecasting expressions for exponential weighted moving averages. Methods for series with no trend, or additive or multiplicative trend are examined. Similarly, the methods cover non-seasonal, and seasonal series with additive or multiplicative error structures. The paper is a reprinted version of the 1957 report to the Office of Naval Research (ONR 52) and is being published here to provide greater accessibility.}

journal = {Management Science},
volume = {6},
number = {3},
pages = {324-342},
abstract = {The growing use of computers for mechanized inventory control and production planning has brought with it the need for explicit forecasts of sales and usage for individual products and materials. These forecasts must be made on a routine basis for thousands of products, so that they must be made quickly, and, both in terms of computing time and information storage, cheaply; they should be responsive to changing conditions. The paper presents a method of forecasting sales which has these desirable characteristics, and which in terms of ability to forecast compares favorably with other, more traditional methods. Several models of the exponential forecasting system are presented, along with several examples of application.},

keywords = {Bagging, Bootstrapping, Exponential smoothing, STL decomposition},
abstract = {Exponential smoothing is one of the most popular forecasting methods. We present a technique for the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of exponential smoothing methods, which results in significant improvements in the forecasts. The bagging uses a Box–Cox transformation followed by an STL decomposition to separate the time series into the trend, seasonal part, and remainder. The remainder is then bootstrapped using a moving block bootstrap, and a new series is assembled using this bootstrapped remainder. An ensemble of exponential smoothing models is then estimated on the bootstrapped series, and the resulting point forecasts are combined. We evaluate this new method on the M3 data set, and show that it outperforms the original exponential smoothing models consistently. On the monthly data, we achieve better results than any of the original M3 participants.}
